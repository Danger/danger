module Danger
  # ### CI Setup
  #
  # With BuildKite you run the server yourself, so you will want to run  it as a part of your build process.
  # It is common to have build steps, so we would recommend adding this to your scrip:
  #
  #  ``` shell
  #   echo "--- Running Danger"
  #   bundle exec danger
  #  ```
  #
  # ### Token Setup
  #
  # As this is self-hosted, you will need to add the `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to your build user's ENV. The alternative
  # is to pass in the token as a prefix to the command `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN="123" bundle exec danger`.
  #
  class Buildkite < CI

      self.repo_slug = repo_matches[2] unless repo_matches.nil?
