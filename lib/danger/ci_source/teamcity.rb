module Danger
  # ### CI Setup
  #
  # You need to go to your project settings. Then depending on the type of your build settings, you may need
  # to add a new build step for Danger. You want to be able to run the command `bundle exec danger`, so
  # the "Simple Command Runner" should be all you need to do that.
  #
  # ### Token + Environment Setup
  #
  # As this is self-hosted, you will need to add the `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to your build user's ENV. The alternative
  # is to pass in the token as a prefix to the command `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN="123" bundle exec danger`.
  #
  # However, you will need to find a way to add the environment vars: `GITHUB_REPO_SLUG`, `GITHUB_PULL_REQUEST_ID` and
  # `GITHUB_REPO_URL`. These are not added by default. You could do this via the GitHub API potentially.
  #
  # We would love some advice on improving this setup.
